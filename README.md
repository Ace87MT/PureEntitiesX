# PureEntitiesX

This is a Fork of the original PureEntities, which went inactive about half a year back. RevivalPMMP is now maintaining it and updating it, so now you can have mobs on your server with this plugin! (At least until Pocketmine implements it)

> PureEntitiesX does not officially provide compatibility with _Third Party PocketMine_ server softwares.
>
> Compatibility can be found with some, but do not complain if it happens not to be.

## Features:

-All mobs Implemented (Besides Bosses) From Pig to Magma Cubes, we've got them all! 

-Auto Spawning of Mobs around players. We don't have them spawn in each loaded chunk, just near players to maximize server performance

-Correct Mob drops. Creepers don't drop Redstone, last we checked, so we updated mobs drops with new items!

-More Configuration Coming Soon! We are adding a config with complete custimizability. Stay Tuned!

## How to Install

There is no Official release yet, because we want to give you the best as possible plugin. You can build it yourself if you want, or download it from Poggit.

It still has some bugs, but it is still very usable, and we will work to get them resolved ASAP. 

## Pocketmine Mob AI

Once Pocketmine comes out with a Mob AI, we plan to migrate our config and custmizability to support it. Once Pocketmine Mob AI comes out, you can be confident that you can keep using PureEntitiesX!

## Plugin Help

Protect an Area from Mob Spawns:

There is no way to do it currentty, but mobs spawn on the highest block in the world, so you can build a big glass layer over your spawn or anywhere else you want to protect.
